## Background on Diabetes Prevalence
Diabetes is a chronic disease that affects how your body turns food into energy. Over **38.4 million Americans** are living with diabetes or prediabetes [@cdc2023diabetes]. Understanding the associated risk factors can help in finding patients with diabetes in the early stage and starting treatments earlier for better outcomes.

## 1. Introduction
This is an analysis of diabetes-related data to explore how different demographic and health factors may relate to diabetes. 

#### Intended Audience
This report is for anyone interested in diabetes, including the general public and those with a basic understanding of health. 

#### Data Source
I used Kaggle dataset by Choksi, which provides detailed health metrics for diabetes research [@choksi2024diabetes].
The data analyzed in this report comes from the "100,000 Diabetes Clinical Dataset" on Kaggle, contributed by Priyam Choksi. This dataset includes 16 demographic and health realated variables for 100,000 individuals and is designed to support diabetes-related research and predictive modeling.

## 3. Data Wrangling
```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(tidyr)
library(ggplot2)
```


```{r}
diabetes_data <- read.csv("diabetes_dataset.csv")

diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>%
  mutate(
    race = case_when(
      race.AfricanAmerican == 1 ~ "African American",
      race.Asian == 1 ~ "Asian",
      race.Caucasian == 1 ~ "Caucasian",
      race.Hispanic == 1 ~ "Hispanic",
      race.Other == 1 ~ "Other",
      TRUE ~ "Unknown"
    )
  ) %>%
  select(-race.AfricanAmerican, -race.Asian, -race.Caucasian, -race.Hispanic, -race.Other)

#change character data to factor
diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>% 
  mutate(smoking_history = factor(smoking_history, levels = c("never", "former", "current", "No Info")))
diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>% 
  mutate(gender = factor(gender, levels = c("Female", "Male")))
diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>% 
  mutate(diabetes = factor(diabetes, levels = c("0", "1")))

#rename hbA1c_level
diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>%
  rename(
    three_month_avg_glucose = hbA1c_level
  )

## 4. Visualization
### 1. Density Plot of BMI by Diabetes Status
```{r}
diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>% filter(!is.na(gender))

ggplot(diabetes_data, aes(x = bmi, color = factor(diabetes), fill = factor(diabetes))) +
  geom_density(alpha = 0.4) +
  labs(
    title = "Density Plot of BMI by Diabetes Status, Faceted by Gender",
    subtitle = "Comparison of BMI density between individuals with and without diabetes across genders",
    x = "BMI",
    y = "Density",
    fill = "Diabetes",
    color = "Diabetes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal() +
  facet_wrap(~ gender, nrow = 2)

```

**Observation on BMI and Diabetes Status**

The density plot shows that people with diabetes tend to have higher BMI values compared to those without diabetes. There is no obvious difference between the distribution of BMI for males and female. This suggests a possible association between higher BMI and diabetes risk.

### 2. Bar Plot of Diabetes by Smoking History
```{r} 
ggplot(diabetes_data, aes(x = smoking_history, fill = factor(diabetes))) +
  geom_bar(position = "dodge") +
  labs(
    title = "Bar Plot of Diabetes Status by Smoking History",
    subtitle = "Distribution of diabetes status among different smoking history categories",
    x = "Smoking History",
    y = "Count",
    fill = "Diabetes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()

```
**Observation on Smoking History and Diabetes Status**

There doesn't appear to be a strong visible association between smoking history and diabetes status in this dataset, as each smoking category shows similar proportions of individuals with and without diabetes. 

### 3. Scatter Plot of HbA1c Level vs. Blood Glucose Level, colored by Diabetes Status
```{r}
ggplot(diabetes_data, aes(x = three_month_avg_glucose, y = blood_glucose_level, color = factor(diabetes))) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.7) +
  labs(
    title = "Scatter Plot of HbA1c Level vs. Blood Glucose Level by Race",
    x = "HbA1c Level (Three months average glucose level)",
    y = "Blood Glucose Level",
    color = "Diabetes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```
::: {column-margin}
```{r}
#| fig-column: margin
#| 
ggplot(diabetes_data, aes(x = diabetes, y = three_month_avg_glucose, fill = diabetes)) +
  geom_violin() +
  labs(title = "Distribution of HbA1c Levels by Diabetes Status") +
  theme_minimal()
```
:::

**Observation on HbA1c Level and Blood Glucose Level**

More individuals with diabetes have higher blood glucose levels compared to those without diabetes.

## 5. Model
```{r}
clean_diabetes_data <- diabetes_data %>%
  filter(!is.na(age), !is.na(gender), !is.na(three_month_avg_glucose), 
         !is.na(bmi), !is.na(smoking_history), 
         !is.na(hypertension), !is.na(heart_disease), !is.na(race))

model <- glm(diabetes ~ age + gender + three_month_avg_glucose + bmi + 
               smoking_history + hypertension + heart_disease + race, 
             data = clean_diabetes_data, family = "binomial")

summary(model)
```

```{r}
# Add predicted probabilities to the dataset
clean_diabetes_data$predicted_prob <- predict(model, type = "response")

# Subsample the data for visualization (to avoid overcrowding)
subset_data <- clean_diabetes_data %>% sample_n(500)

# Plot predicted probabilities against a key variable
ggplot(subset_data, aes(x = three_month_avg_glucose, y = predicted_prob, color = diabetes)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(method = "loess", se = FALSE, color = "black") +
  labs(
    title = "Predicted Probability of Diabetes by HbA1c Level",
    x = "HbA1c Level (Three months average glucose level)",
    y = "Predicted Probability of Diabetes"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
```


## 6. Conclusion
In conclusion, we see that higher BMI values are associated with diabetes risk, because we can see from the density plot that people with diabetes tend to have higher BMI values. Smoking history does not seem to be a strong predictor of diabetes status in this dataset, as the bar plot shows similar proportions of individuals with and without diabetes across smoking categories. 
The scatter plot of HbA1c levels vs. blood glucose levels colored by diabetes status shows a clear separation between individuals with and without diabetes, with higher blood glucose levels associated with diabetes. The logistic regression model shows that important predictor of diabetes status including age, gender , three_month_avg_glucose, bmi, smoking_history, hypertension, heart_disease.
