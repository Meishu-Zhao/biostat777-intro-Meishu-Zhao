The analysis is presented in a straightforward manner, avoiding complex statistical jargon, so that anyone with a basic understanding of health concepts can follow along and gain insights.\n\n\n\nThis analysis uses the Kaggle dataset by Choksi, which provides detailed health metrics for diabetes research (Choksi 2024). The data analyzed in this report comes from the “100,000 Diabetes Clinical Dataset” on Kaggle, contributed by Priyam Choksi. This dataset includes demographic and health information for 100,000 individuals and is designed to support diabetes-related research and predictive modeling. It provides information on gender, age, race, hypertension, heart disease, smoking history, BMI, HbA1c levels, blood glucose levels, and diabetes status."
